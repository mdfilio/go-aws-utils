# go-aws-utils
CLI utilities written in go using aws go sdk

Makes use of a go routine and WaitGroup in order to get faster execution time against all 14 normal public aws regions.

## instancelist

Currently outputs the following (print skips empty regions):

```
Oregon                  us-west-2 : 2   
Instance ID      State        OS         Type               VPC          Subnet        Public IP        Private IP       Name
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i-xxxxxxxx      running      Linux     t2.micro        vpc-xxxxxxxx  subnet-xxxxxxxx   xx.xx.xx.xx      172.31.20.191                                  
i-xxxxxxxx      running      Linux     t2.micro        vpc-xxxxxxxx  subnet-xxxxxxxx   xx.xx.xx.x       172.31.20.224    test      
```

This should eventually go into awsresources as a switch, but good coding is hard and I needed the original version of this much faster.

## awsresources

Currently outputs the following:

* Snet = Subnets
* CD = CodeDeploy
* CF = Number of Cloudformation stacks
* ECS = Number of ECS clusters
* L = Number of Lambda functions
* SS = Number of Snapshots
* DDB = Number of DynamoDB tables

Rest should be fairly obvious.

Additonal NOTES:

* Snapshots has a hidden dependency. If the **AWS_ACCOUNT** enviornment variable is not set it will return 0.
* ECS currently not available in São Paulo or Mumbai and also return 0.
